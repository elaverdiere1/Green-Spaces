# Sustainable Citis Hackathon

The Main proposal of the hackathon was to create a product that could help create a more sustainable city.

My group worked on improving green spaces for both quality and accessability.

We created a phone app portotype for potential park access aong with information about the park.

The main data analysis involved the park information from NYC open source data along with data about park funding and income inequality.
